This game was created over the course of several months using C# and unity. All of the programming, and most of the art was done by Isaac Sheridan.
- Day night system, where lighting, available fish, dialogue, and npc locations change over time.
- A fleshed out inventory system, with quick sorting and stacking to nearby chests
- 28 characters with unique dialogues and schedules throughout the town
- 4 skills, farming, foraging, fishing, and mining, to raise and unlock new things with
- Saving locally every night, so you can stop and start playing later
- Mines and forests to explore, that change every time you enter
- Cutscenes filled with "animations" and dialogue. (I'm not here to show off my pixel art and animation skills)
- Fishing minigames with different difficulties and AIs based on the fish being hooked
- And much more!

I put a lot of time into this game, the story is only just started, and there is currently no sounds ( I recommend putting on a Stardew Valley music playlist while you play) but I hope you all enjoy!
