Dialogue|Din|Drest smiles on me today! Yes yes!|||

Dialogue|Din|Oh my! PLAYER, you startled me! I didn't see you there!|||
Dialogue|Din|Haha! Look at this, see! This is Drenvine. I can use this, when prepared in the right way of course, to help push back sickness!|||
Dialogue|Din|You see... Sophia told me she had a sore throat, so I knew that she might be getting sick, so I knew I just had to find her some Drenvine to help her feel better!|||
Dialogue|Din|So I got looking and looking all over the forest for some, but I just couldn't find any, no no.|||
Dialogue|Din|But on my way back here, right at home I thought I saw some out off the corner of my eye, yes yes!|||
Dialogue|Din|So when I got to looking right around my very own house, you won't believe what I found! That's right! Right here, our very own Drenvine!|||

Choice|Din|Have I confused you? Do you need me to explain it again?|No.|Certainly not|
Dialogue|Din|Yes yes! I'm glad you understand!|||
Dialogue|Din|Drest works in mysterious ways... He really is quite the trickster...|||
Emote|Player|1|DotDotDot||
Dialogue|Din|Ah... I suppose you wouldn't know who Drest is. Few do nowadays...|||
Dialogue|Din|That's the church's influence for you. Trying to erase the old gods. I won't forget them. No no...|||
Dialogue|Din|Nevermind me... I've probably taken up too much of your time already...|||
Dialogue|Din|Well, enjoy your day now! Come on over if you need any medicines!|||
