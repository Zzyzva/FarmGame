Dialogue|Todd|Morning, PLAYER. Just wanted to tell you that Graham and I removed that boulder in the south of the town.||||||
Dialogue|Todd|It was blocking the way to the mountain. There's an older lady by the name of Zes up there who you should meet, and there's also a mine.||||||
Dialogue|Todd|The mine is pretty dangerous though, I wouldn't go in if I were you.||||||

Dialogue|Todd|But if you WERE to go in, I could use the coal and ore you find to upgrade your gear. Just a thought.||||||
Dialogue|Todd|Well that's all I had to say, nice farm by the way.||||||

Dialogue|Todd|All right, enjoy your day!||||||
