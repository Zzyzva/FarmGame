Dialogue|Derrick|It's my job.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|We don't get outsiders. No one wants to come to this poor little village.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|And one day you stumble in claiming you have no memories?||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|It's strange, kid.||||||

Dialogue|Derrick|Now I'm not saying I don't believe you. You seem like an upstanding lad.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|Right now, at least.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|But what were you doing around our village before you lost your memory? How did you get here? It makes an old man like me suspicious.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|I want to trust you kid. But if any of your memories come back, you tell me, all right?||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|It's my job to protect these people. They're good people.||||||
Dialogue|Derrick|And with times how they are...||||||
