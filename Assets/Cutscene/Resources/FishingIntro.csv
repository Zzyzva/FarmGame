Dialogue|Olivia|Gooooooooood morning!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|It is I, the legendary fisherwoman... OLIVIA!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|There is no fish that swims that I cannot wrangle! Please... hold your applause.||||||

Dialogue|Olivia|Ahem... Yes... anyways... I heard that someone new was living here and I thought it would be a good idea to show them the way of the rod.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|I've did the same when Vintius, Emily, and Emilio all moved here, and for each of the locals when they became of age.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|So don't think you're special! Yet... You will become special when you master the rod, when you become a master fisher like myself...||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|If you become a master fisher, that is. It takes practice, patience, cunning, skill, dexterity, and so much more. It is no simple task!||||||

Dialogue|Olivia|All right, listen close.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 1! Find a body of water. Any water will do, and each different type of water will have different fish. Explore the world for different spots!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 2! Cast your rod into the water.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 3! Wait...||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 4! Keep waiting...||||||
Emote|Olivia|1|Exclamation|||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 5! Reel it in (use the fishing rod item again) when you get a bite!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|STEP 6! Here is where your mettle will truly be tested. PAY ATTENTION! This part is important.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|You must first angle your rod in the perfect way (hover your mouse of the fish).||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|Then, once your rod is angled, begin reeling in the fish as fast as you can (smash the spacebar repeatedly).||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|The fish will try to escape, so continue to angle your rod and reel until the fish is yours!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|Some fish are stronger than others, and you might not be able to catch them all... yet... But do not give up! Keep practicing and one day you to may become a LEGENDARY FISHERWOMAN like myself!||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|Once you improve your skills a bit, come drop by my shop for new rods, baits, and other fishing tools. I won't sell to the unworthy, you must prove yourself with practice first.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|My shop is open on the weekends in the market square.||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|Well.... that's all I have for you. Practice the way of the rod, young one, I have faith in you. Something about you seems special to me...||||||
Dialogue|Olivia|I've got fish to catch! Goodbye now! Good luck!||||||
